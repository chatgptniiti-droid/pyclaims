## What changed

### Public API

| Change | Type | Details |
|---|---|---|
| `create_claim()` | Confirmed preferred path | Use this for all new and migrated integrations. Returns `(Claim, RequestMeta)`. |
| `submit_claim()` | Deprecated | Still works; delegates to `create_claim()`. Remove from integrations — will be removed in a future release. |
| `upload_document(content_type=)` | New parameter | Optional `content_type` added (default `"application/pdf"`) on both sync and async clients. |
| `retry_on_429` | Removed | No longer accepted. Use `max_retries` on the client constructor. |
| `timeout_seconds` | Carried from 0.8.0 | Constructor parameter on both `ClaimClient` and `AsyncClaimClient` (default `30`). |

### Documentation refreshed

| File | What changed |
|---|---|
| `docs/api/client.md` | Full rewrite: corrected constructor signature, return types, deprecation notices, added `AsyncClaimClient` section. |
| `docs/api_reference.md` | Expanded from a bare list to full field-level model documentation. |
| `docs/getting_started.md` | Fixed `create_claim()` return value unpacking; added `content_type` example; added `get_claim_status` example. |
| `docs/async.md` | Fixed `create_claim()` return value unpacking; added `content_type` example. |
| `docs/migration_guide.md` | Added 0.8.0 and 0.9.0 migration sections covering `submit_claim` → `create_claim`, `retry_on_429` removal, and the 0.8.0 return type change. |
| `docs/changelog.md` | Added 0.8.0 and 0.9.0 entries; all changes are now recorded. |
| `docs/releases/0_9_0_preview.md` | Updated from speculative draft language to confirmed release notes. |
| `docs/parameter_matrix.md` | Added `timeout_seconds`, `content_type`, `AsyncClaimClient`, and deprecation note for `submit_claim`. |

## Key doc issues resolved

1. **Stale constructor signature** — `docs/api/client.md` was missing `timeout_seconds` (added in 0.8.0).
2. **Wrong return type in examples** — multiple docs showed `claim = client.create_claim(...)` instead of `claim, meta = ...`. Fixed across getting started, async, and API reference.
3. **Absent `AsyncClaimClient` docs** — the async client had no reference entry. Added full section.
4. **Outdated migration guide** — was a placeholder. Now covers both 0.8.0 and 0.9.0 breaking and deprecated changes.
5. **Draft preview** — `0_9_0_preview.md` used speculative language ("may be introduced"). Updated to reflect the confirmed implementation.
